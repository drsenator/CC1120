CC1120
======

C code to test the Texas Instruments CC1120 Transceiver.
Designed to be compiled for Arduino Uno.
Perhaps this could be modified for compilation using gcc.

There is no copyright on this at all.

This code was written based on the swru295e.pdf document for the Texas Instruments CC1120 Transceiver. The code is incomplete (it only has basic commands, and lacks a list of them, see "transceiver" by TheDorkKnight for those codes).
